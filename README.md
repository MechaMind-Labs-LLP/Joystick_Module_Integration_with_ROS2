# Joystick_Module_Integration_with_ROS2
This project demonstrates how to integrate a joystick module with a ROS 2 environment. It involves reading analog joystick input (X, Y axes and optional button press) from a microcontroller and publishing the data via Serial communication to ROS 2 topics. The integration enables joystick-based control of robots or other ROS 2-enabled systems.
